Here is an overview of the different steps required to become an active
validator on an Ethereum network.

* Consolidate ETH for each active validator you want (You can have
a large amount of active validators using a single machine and this setup)
* Install an Ethereum beacon node and let it synchronize
* Install an Ethereum execution client and let it synchronize
* Generate your validator(s) keys
* Install an Ethereum validator client and import your key(s)
* Perform the deposit for each validator
* Wait for your validator(s) to become active (can take a few minutes/hours)
